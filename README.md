#myflix-client

In this project I worked on putting the backend API I had created before and applied it into a functioning appliction with a frontend.
While this was a project to understand React, I've better understood what the purpose of a library or framework is.

In myflix, the primary goal was to create an API with multiple different end points and type (ie. Get, Post, Put, Delete). And in this part of the project, I had to create 
multiple different views. These views are as follows: 
         - login-view
         - main-view
         - movies-list 
         - movie-card
         - movie-view
         - director-view
         - genre-view
         - profile-view
         - visibility-filter-input
         - movie-list
         - registration-view
           
These views utilize react-bootstrap and react-router in order to create basic UI elements and in order to travel between pages. As well as using Axios when needing to access the
myflix database. Nearing the end of completion, I was introduced to Redux and I had incorporated a search function to fliter movies by the matching characters.
